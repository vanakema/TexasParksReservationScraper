# TexasParksReservationScraper
A quickly made scraper for the Texas Parks Reservation system

## Disclaimer:
I made this for private use initially, and to experiment more with Python. I fully admit that I do not know Python's best practices, but I wanted to experiment with things unique to Python such as inner methods. I am well aware that some refactoring is needed to make this easier to understand, and to split thing out into separate files, but for my purposes, it works well. I'd be happy to talk about the code with whomever is interested. This repo was made public so I could have some code samples of stuff I've worked on in my free time besides my machine learning course.
